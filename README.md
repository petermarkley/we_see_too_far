# “We see too far”
Recently a flat earther sent me [this](https://wiki.24-7flatearth.org/index.php/Observations), which for a moment almost impressed me. It's rare to see flat earthers attempt to compile their claims into any sort of structure, let alone quantitative data that invites analysis. I was delighted!

Naturally, I took the invitation. What I found was disappointing, but of course did not surprise me.
